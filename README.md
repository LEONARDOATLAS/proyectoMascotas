## Nombre 
TIENDA DE MOSCOTAS - tiendaMoscotas

## Descripción.

En Colombia el 43% de los hogares tiene al menos una mascota según un informe de la Federación Nacional de Comerciantes (Fenalco), además se estima que en el 2023, los colombianos gastarán más de 2 billones de pesos en productos y servicios para sus mascotas, según datos de Euromonitor International.

En la actualidad se ofrecen una amplia variedad de productos con diferentes características para satisfacer las necesidades de las mascotas en los hogares colombianos. Los dueños a la hora de escoger un producto tienen que elegir basándose en múltiples criterios que pueden ser difíciles de evaluar, como la satisfacción de su mascota con el producto o la calidad/precio ofrecida por estos.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
